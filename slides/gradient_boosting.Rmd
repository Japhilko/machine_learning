## [**Advantages of gradient boosting**](http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression)

- Often provides predictive accuracy that cannot be beat.
- Lots of flexibility - can optimize on different loss functions and provides several hyperparameter tuning options that make the function fit very flexible.
- No data pre-processing required - often works great with categorical and numerical values as is.
- Handles missing data - imputation not required.

## [**Disadvantages**](http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression) of gradient boosting


- GBMs will continue improving to minimize all errors. This can overemphasize outliers and cause overfitting. Must use cross-validation to neutralize.
- Computationally expensive - GBMs often require many trees (>1000) which can be time and memory exhaustive.
- The high flexibility results in many parameters that interact and influence heavily the behavior of the approach (number of iterations, tree depth, regularization parameters, etc.). This requires a large grid search during tuning.
- Less interpretable although this is easily addressed with various tools (variable importance, partial dependence plots, LIME, etc.).


## Two types of errors for tree methods

### Bias related errors

- Adaptive boosting
- Gradient boosting

### Variance related errors

- Bagging
- Random forest

What if we, instead of reweighting examples, made some corrections to prediction errors directly?

Residual is a gradient of single observation error contribution in one of the most common evaluation measure for regression: RMSE
