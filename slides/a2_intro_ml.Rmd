## [Modern Machine Learning Algorithms](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms)

Categorizing machine learning algorithms is tricky, and there are several reasonable approaches; they can be grouped into generative/discriminative, parametric/non-parametric, supervised/unsupervised, and so on.

## [Machine Learning - Components](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140822073217-180198720-6-components-of-a-machine-learning-algorithm)

- Feature Extraction + Domain knowledge

- Feature Selection

- Choice of Algorithm

Naive Bayes, [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/SupportVectorMachines.md), Decision Trees, k-Means Clustering, ...

- Training

- Choice of Metrics/Evaluation Criteria

- Testing


## [Feature selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection)


## [Supervised vs unsupervised learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d)

### Supervised Learning 

- we have prior knowledge of what the output values for our samples should be. 


## Task: Find R-packages

Go to https://cran.r-project.org/ and search for packages that,...

- can be used for lasso regression
