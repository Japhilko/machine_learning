## What is [lasso regression](http://www.statisticshowto.com/lasso-regression/)

- Lasso regression uses shrinkage
- data values are shrunk towards a central point

- [Ridge and lasso regularization work by adding a penalty term to the log likelihood function.](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/a-gentle-introduction-to-logistic-regression-and-lasso-regularisation-using-r/)

- A tuning parameter, $\lambda$ controls the strength of the L1 penalty.
