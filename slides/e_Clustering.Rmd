## hdbscan

A fairly new alternative to kmeans, hdbscan does not require you to
specify the number of categories to be assigned. It only requires a
decision as to the minimum number of points needed to be included in a
cluster. This minimum number acts as a smoothing paramter (such as a
density bandwidth parameter or a histograms bin/bar width), with lower
values finding more clusters. Other advantages of hdbscan include .

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dbscan")
```



```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(dbscan)


data(moons)

## Running HDBscan with the minimum number of points set to 5.
res <- dbscan::hdbscan(moons, minPts = 3)

plot(moons, col = res$cluster + 1, main="R implementation")
```
