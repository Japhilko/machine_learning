# Why Python? Isn't this an R course?




# Installing Python



# Calling python from R using reticulate

```{r}
library(reticulate)


```
## The minimum you need to be aware of
Python, just like R, has different kinds of objects. Some commonly
used ones are:

1. Integers (1, 2, 3, 4,...)
2. Decimal (.34234, .123, pi)
   (Called "numeric" in R, "floats" in Python).
3. DataFrame (from the pandas library in R).
4. Array (called a matrix in R).
5. Series (called a vector in R).

There are many other kinds of objects (and you can create your
own). The relevant point for using reticulate is that you need to make
sure the kind of object you are using in R is being converted to the
right kind of object for the python function you are trying to make
use of.

If a function in python requires an integer, you can't simply pass it
a number from R, as R defaults to using "numeric" objects to represent
numbers. You have to convert the "numeric" to an "integer" first.

```{r}

a.number <- 1

class(a.number)

class(as.integer(a.number))

```
