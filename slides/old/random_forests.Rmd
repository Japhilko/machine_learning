Grow a tree

```{r}
fit <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start,
   method="class", data=kyphosis)

printcp(fit) # display the results
plotcp(fit) # visualize cross-validation results
summary(fit) # detailed summary of splits
```

```{r}
# plot tree
plot(fit, uniform=TRUE,
   main="Classification Tree for Kyphosis")
text(fit, use.n=TRUE, all=TRUE, cex=.8)
```

## [Random Forest](https://www.datascience.com/resources/notebooks/random-forest-intro)

> Random forest aims to reduce the previously mentioned correlation issue by choosing only a subsample of the feature space at each split. Essentially, it aims to make the trees de-correlated and prune the trees by setting a stopping criteria for node splits, which I will cover in more detail later.

## [Random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)

- Ensemble learning method - multitude of decision trees 
- Random forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
