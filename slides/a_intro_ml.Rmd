## Intro Machine Learning

Categorizing machine learning algorithms is tricky

- ... they can be grouped into generative/discriminative, parametric/non-parametric, supervised/unsupervised, and so on.

-  Scikit-Learn’s documentation page groups algorithms by their learning mechanism. This produces categories such as: Generalized linear models,     Support vector machines, nearest neighbors, decision trees, neural networks, ...


## [Machine Learning - Components](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140822073217-180198720-6-components-of-a-machine-learning-algorithm)

- Feature Extraction + Domain knowledge

- Feature Selection

- Choice of Algorithm

Naive Bayes, [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/SupportVectorMachines.md), Decision Trees, k-Means Clustering, ...

- Training

- Choice of Metrics/Evaluation Criteria

- Testing

## [Supervised vs unsupervised learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d)

### Supervised Learning 

- we have prior knowledge of what the output values for our samples should be. 


## Task: Find R-packages

Go to https://cran.r-project.org/ and search for packages that,...

- can be used for lasso regression

## [Time measurement](https://www.r-bloggers.com/5-ways-to-measure-running-time-of-r-code/)

```{r}
start_time <- Sys.time()
ab <- runif(10000000)
end_time <- Sys.time()

end_time - start_time
```


## How many cores are available


```{r}
library(doParallel)
detectCores()
```

## 

```{r}
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores())
registerDoParallel(cl)
```

```{r}
start_time <- Sys.time()
ab <- runif(10000000)
end_time <- Sys.time()

end_time - start_time
```

```{r}
stopCluster(cl)
```


```{r,eval=F}
?parallel::makeCluster
```
