## Target of the course

- What is machine learning?
- Why do we need it? / When do we need it?
- How to prepare your data for ML

## Preliminaries

- This topic is huge - we concentrate on presenting the applications in R
- Usually we have big differences in knowledge and abilities of the participants - please tell, if it is too fast or slow.
- We have many [**exercises**](http://web.math.ku.dk/~helle/R-intro/exercises.pdf) because at the end you can only learn on your own
- We have many [**examples**](https://www.showmeshiny.com/) - try them!
- If there are questions - always ask
- R is more fun together - ask your neighbor



## Introduction round

### Please tell us shortly...

- Where are you from? What are you studying/working?
- What is your experience level in R/other programming languages?
- What are your expectations of this course?
- Where do you think you can use Machine Learning in the future?




## [Prediction vs interpretability](https://machinelearningmastery.com/model-prediction-versus-interpretation-in-machine-learning/)

- We have a trade-off of model prediction accuracy versus model interpretation.

- It is critical to have a clear idea of the which is a priority


## [Bootstrapping](https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/bootstrapping.html)

- [**Bootstrap**](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/bootstrap-r) is a method of inference about a population using sample data.

## [The curse of dimensionality](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-curse-of-dimensionality-how-we-can-save-big-data-from-itself-d9fa0f872335/)

- We have a high number of possible features
- We want to find the best representation of data in a lower-dimensional space
