## Exercise: Kmeans

Apply kmeans to to the `iris` dataset with 2, 3, and 4
clusters. Produce three scatter plots, with the points colored
according to cluster assignment.


## hdbscan

A fairly new alternative to kmeans, hdbscan does not require you to
specify the number of categories to be assigned. It only requires a
decision as to the minimum number of points needed to be included in a
cluster. This minimum number acts as a smoothing parameter (such as a
density bandwidth parameter or a histograms bin/bar width), with lower
values finding more clusters. Other advantages of hdbscan include .











## Exercise: Apply kmeans to the moons dataset and compare the results. 
-- Be sure to try different numbers of centers.


## Exercise: Apply hdbscan to the moons dataset with different minimums for the number of points. 

## Exercise: Apply both kmeans and hdbscan to the `ChickWeight` dataset's "weight" "Time" variables, and see how well you can get each to perform.
