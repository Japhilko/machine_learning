## [Three datasets to build a model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets)

- In machine learning the model is initially fit on a training dataset that is a set of examples used to fit the parameters.

-  the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second dataset called the validation dataset.

```{r}
library(ROCR)
data(ROCR.simple)
pred <- prediction(ROCR.simple$predictions,ROCR.simple$labels)
```
