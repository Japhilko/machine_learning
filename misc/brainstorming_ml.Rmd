## [Supervised vs unsupervised learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d) (essentially regression/classification vs EDA)

- Exploratory data analysis



Bias-variance tradeoff

Curse of dimensionality

Cross-validation

LASSO, Ridge and elasticnet

Kernal regression? 

Bagging and boosting 

CART (classification and regression trees)

Classification

Support vector machines (both classification and regression).

Neural networks (plus gradient descent)
       Perceptron
       Multilayer perceptron (aka  feedforward neural network with two or more layers)
       backpropagation

Causal graphs/search algorithms
